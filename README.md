# DogFinder
Simple bit of Python code to query various dog rescue websites and provide a summary list of suitable dogs (available, child-friendly and local).  
The searches on the various sites aren't always reliable, and it's handy to have a single list that covers multiple sites.
Future Enhancement ideas:
- output should have a photo and description from the original website.
- DogsTrust could do with more filtering, e.g. they often say "could live with children 16 or older", so we need to check that age too.
